# composite-optimization-code
Code for "Global Convergence of Model Function Based Bregman Proximal Minimization Algorithms" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13161.pdf)

# Description
This code contains three folders, namely,

- standard-phase-retrieval:
  - <b>Description:</b> Contains the standard phase retrieval problem experiments given in Section 5.1 in the paper.
- robust-phase-retrieval:
  - <b>Description:</b> Contains the robust phase retrieval problem  experiments given in Section 5.2 in the paper.
- poisson_linear_inverse_problems:
  - <b>Description:</b> Contains the Poisson linear inverse problem  experiments given in Section 5.3 in the paper.

Each folder has its own README file, which contains details regarding that corresponding experiment.
